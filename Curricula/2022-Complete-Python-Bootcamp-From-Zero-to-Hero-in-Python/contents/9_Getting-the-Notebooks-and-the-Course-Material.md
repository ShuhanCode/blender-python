#  9. Getting the Notebooks and the Course Material

Hi, everyone.

I just wanted to take this lecture to very quickly show you how you can download the course notebooks

and open them on your computer in case you're having any issues with that.

If you've already been able to do that just from the links from the FAQ lecture or the course overview

lecture, feel free to skip this lecture.

But basically all I'm going to do here is show you how you can actually download the notes from our

GitHub page.

So you should have seen a little blue pop up with a resource link, and that resource link will take

you to the GitHub page for period data and the complete Python three boot camp.

So go to this resource link.

You can either type it in manually Google search it or just use the little blue pop up that happened

when you were watching this lecture.

So let's hop over to that link.

So here we are at that GitHub repository, and this is basically an online repository that you can access

in order to get the actual course notes.

You'll see here how the course notes are organized.

We basically have it numbered off by section, and then inside of these sections you'll see the notebooks

themselves and the notebooks are titled both so that their lecture title matches as best we could with

the notebook title, and then we also have them kind of numbered, so you can go through them in order.

So for example, when you're learning about for loops, you'll go ahead and click here on for loops

and this will eventually load up the notebook.

Notice how it's a P and B file, but once you have the notebook loaded, you should see lots of useful

information here and then the actual code itself.

Now, if you want to run these notebooks onto your computer, what you need to do is download this repository.

So we'll come back here, click on Complete Python three boot camp.

And there's different ways you can download this repository.

If you're already familiar with Git, you can feel free to fork this repository and then have it on

your own.

GitHub.

Keep in mind we are constantly updating this, but what you can do also to just get the files locally

is click here where it says clone or download and then click on download zip and that will download

a zip file which you can then unzip and that will have all the IP and B files that you can then access

using your Anaconda Navigator, as we showed in the running python code lecture.

All right.

That's just a very quick overview of how to get the notes.

If you ever have any questions on this, feel free to post the Q&A forums, but definitely check out

the FAQ lecture where we have more detailed instructions on how to do all this.

Okay, thanks everyone.

We'll see you at the next lecture.
