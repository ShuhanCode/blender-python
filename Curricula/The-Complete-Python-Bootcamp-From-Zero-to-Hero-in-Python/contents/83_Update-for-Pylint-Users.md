# 83. Update for Pylint Users

Hi Everyone,

Just a quick update on the Pylint library. To see the same report that I do in the video, in the newest version of PyLint you need to add -r y (report yes) at the end of the command, so the full command should be:

```python
pylint myexample.py -r y
```     

If you check out the video I only wrote `pylint myexample.py` , you will need to add on `-r y`

Check out the previously answered QA Forum posts if you get stuck on this, thanks!

Jose
