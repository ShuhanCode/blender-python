Okay so you now know functions!

A big part of this section of the course will be testing your new skills with exercises. **We have 3 main parts of exercises.**

**Part 1: 10 In Course Coding Exercises** 

We're going to start off with just the basics with a series of 10 problems. These problems should feel relatively easy, just some quick exercises to get you comfortable with the syntax of functions. If you feel uncomfortable with these, check out lecture 26 for some useful links for warm-up problems from codingbat.com , but hopefully these exercises should feel relatively easy.

These are in-course coding exercises. Solutions can be found linked here:

In between these in-course coding exercises we'll have a quick lecture on *args and **kwargs.

**Part 2: Function Practice Exercises**

Here we'll have a jupyter notebook with some exercises for you to answer, we'll have a quick overview lecture, and then have you attempt problems, afterwards we'll have an explanatory solutions video. These problems are ranked WarmUp, Level 1, Level 2, and Challenge. You should feel comfortable with Warmup and Level 1 and Level 2. Challenge problems here are very difficult, so don't feel bad if you don't want to attempt them yet! :)

After this we'll cover a few more topics through some videos.

**Part 3:  Function and Methods Homework**

We finish off this section with even more exercises! Here we have various function word problems for you to solve, again in a notebook and we will cover the solutions in a video afterwards.

Best of luck! If you have any questions, post to the QA forums and we'll be happy to help you out!
