# 5. Notes on Updates Versions of Django

Notes on Updated Versions of Bootstrap 4 and Django 2.x

**VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON UPDATES TO BOOTSTRAP AND DJANGO PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS. THANK YOU!**

Since this course has been recorded, Bootstrap has finally released version 4 and Django is updated about once every 3 months, so they are now on some version of 2.x

This course was filmed with Bootstrap 3 and Django 1.11 (it was originally recorded in 1.9 and then I updated for 1.10, then I updated videos again for 1.11).

So then the common question we get from students is what version should they be using of each while going through the course?

**Here is what we highly recommend for you to go through the course and videos with no issues:**

During the Bootstrap Section of the course.

1. Use the same Bootstrap 3 CDN we show in the video. This is the same CDN link we use in the videos and the original .zip file. You can access the CDN link and Bootstrap 3.3.7 docs here:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/

During the Django portion of the course

2. Later on we will discuss virtual environments and installing Django with a conda install or pip install. If you just do pip install django, it will download the latest version, which won't be the same as in the video. So instead use the following command:

```
pip install django==1.11
```

Okay that is all!

But now, what if you do want access to the same notes and projects, but with Bootstrap 4 and Django 2.0? No problem! We've released an updated version of the note files and you can download them as a resource for this lecture. 

**Please note, the videos do not follow these updated versions, the videos still follow Bootstrap 3 and Django 1.11, overall the versions are extremely similar and it shouldn't be an issue effecting your general understanding of Bootstrap or Django, which is why we recommend just using the video versions.**

Thanks!

Jose
