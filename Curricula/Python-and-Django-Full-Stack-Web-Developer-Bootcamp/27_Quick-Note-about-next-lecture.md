# 27. Quick Note about next lecture

Hey everyone!

A quick note, in the next lecture CSS Level One Part Three, I accidentally say the word "class" instead of "id" at the 6:40 mark. The hashtag (#) is the way you reference an id, not a class. Later on I say it correctly, but from 6:40 to about the 7:00 minute mark I accidentally say the word class instead of id there.

Sorry about that, I will try to get this updated soon in the video, but feel free to post any questions to the QA forums in the meantime.
