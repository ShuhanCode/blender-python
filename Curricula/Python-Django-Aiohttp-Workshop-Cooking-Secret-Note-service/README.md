##  Description

This course requires knowledge of the Junior Python Developer level. If you do not have sufficient knowledge, this course will be a challenge for you. But if you take this course, I promise that you will learn a lot of interesting information and get a new project in your portfolio. This course is a workshop. This means that the course is a live project development, as if I collected it for a real customer.

It shows the live development process from A to Z, with all the bugs and problems that arise during development and with solutions to these problems.
