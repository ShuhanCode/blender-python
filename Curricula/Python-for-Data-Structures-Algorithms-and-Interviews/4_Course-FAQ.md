# 4. Course FAQ

**Course FAQ**

**1. Where can I find the materials for the technical section of the course?**

You can download them as a zip file in the resource lecture in the **Technical Break Section** of the course!

Or you can view them online here:

**2. Which half of the course should I do first, Non-Technical or Technical?**

That's up to you. If you're more than 4 months away from interviewing, just do the course in sequential order.

If you have interviews coming up in less than a month, you might want to jump to the technical prep section, as well as overlooking the non-technical sectiosn focusing on what to do during an interview.
