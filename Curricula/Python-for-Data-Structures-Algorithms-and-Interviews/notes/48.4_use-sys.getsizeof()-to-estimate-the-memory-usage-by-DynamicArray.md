# How to use `sys.getsizeof()` or `tracemalloc` to get an estimate of the memory usage of the `DynamicArray`?

you can use `sys.getsizeof()` to get an estimate of the memory usage of the `DynamicArray` and its underlying array. However, keep in mind that the value returned by `sys.getsizeof()` might not provide an accurate representation of the actual memory usage.

`sys.getsizeof()` returns the size of the object in bytes, but it doesn't take into account the memory overhead of the Python interpreter or other optimizations that Python might apply. Additionally, `sys.getsizeof()` only provides the size of the Python object and not the memory used by the elements stored in the array.

Here's an example of how you can use `sys.getsizeof()` to get the size of the `DynamicArray` object:

```python
import sys

# Assuming the DynamicArray class is defined as before
dynamic_array = DynamicArray()

# Append some elements to the array
for i in range(100):
    dynamic_array.append(i)

# Get the size of the DynamicArray object in bytes
size_of_dynamic_array = sys.getsizeof(dynamic_array)
print("Size of DynamicArray:", size_of_dynamic_array, "bytes")
```

However, to get a more accurate memory usage estimate, you could use the `tracemalloc` module, which provides more detailed memory tracing capabilities. Using `tracemalloc`, you can measure memory usage before and after specific operations, allowing you to see how much memory your data structures consume in total. Here's an example of how you can use `tracemalloc`:

```python
import tracemalloc

# Assuming the DynamicArray class is defined as before
dynamic_array = DynamicArray()

# Enable tracing
tracemalloc.start()

# Append some elements to the array
for i in range(100):
    dynamic_array.append(i)

# Measure memory usage after appending elements
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics("lineno")

for stat in top_stats[:10]:
    print(stat)

# Disable tracing
tracemalloc.stop()
```

Keep in mind that memory usage can be affected by many factors, and accurately measuring memory consumption in Python can be challenging. It's essential to understand the limitations of each method and use them accordingly based on your specific use case.
