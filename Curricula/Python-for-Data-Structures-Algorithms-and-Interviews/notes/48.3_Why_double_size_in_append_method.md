# 48.3 Why double size in `append(self, ele)`?  

In the original code, the line `self._resize(2 * self.capacity)` is used to double the capacity of the dynamic array whenever it becomes full. Doubling the capacity helps reduce the number of resizing operations and provides an amortized constant-time complexity for most `append` operations, which is a common resizing strategy for dynamic arrays.

However, this strategy may not be the most efficient in all scenarios. Sometimes, you may have a use case where you expect the dynamic array to grow slowly, and doubling the capacity could result in a significant waste of memory.

Keep in mind that the choice of resizing strategy depends on the specific use case and the expected pattern of element additions. If you expect frequent and large batches of elements to be appended, the doubling strategy might be more appropriate. On the other hand, if you expect a gradual growth or occasional additions, the incremental strategy can be more memory-friendly.
