# 48.2 how to use `make_array`?

To use the `make_array` method, you need to have an instance of the `DynamicArray` class (as defined in the initial code) since the method is part of that class. Once you have an instance, you can call the `make_array` method to create a new dynamic array (C-style array) with a specified capacity. Here's how you can use it:

```python
import ctypes

class DynamicArray(object):
    """
    DYNAMIC ARRAY CLASS (Similar to Python List)
    """
    
    # ... (Other methods and constructor as defined in the initial code) ...
    
    def make_array(self, new_cap):
        return (new_cap * ctypes.py_object)()

# Creating an instance of DynamicArray
dynamic_array = DynamicArray()

# Using make_array to create a new array
new_capacity = 10
new_array = dynamic_array.make_array(new_capacity)

# The new_array is a dynamic array with a capacity of 10.
# It can store Python objects, similar to a Python list.
# However, it's not directly accessible as a Python list, and you need to work with it using ctypes or other low-level approaches.

# For example, you can store values in the new array using ctypes:
for i in range(new_capacity):
    new_array[i] = i * 2

# Accessing elements in the new array:
for i in range(new_capacity):
    print(new_array[i])

# Note: This new_array is a C-style array and not directly usable as a Python list.
# If you want a dynamic array similar to Python's list, you should use the DynamicArray class and its append method as described in the initial code.

```

It's essential to understand that the `make_array` method creates a low-level dynamic array using C-style array concepts from the `ctypes` module. While it can store Python objects like a list, it is not directly accessible using standard Python list methods. If you want a dynamic array with list-like behavior, you should use the `DynamicArray` class with its `append` method, as shown in the initial code. The `DynamicArray` class handles the low-level memory management and provides a more user-friendly interface for working with dynamic arrays in Python.
