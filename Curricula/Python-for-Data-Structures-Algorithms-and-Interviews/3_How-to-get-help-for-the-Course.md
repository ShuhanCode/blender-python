2. If you do need to post to the discussion forum , ask good questions!

For technical section questions:

Before asking a discussion question, you should try:

1. Debugging your code

- Check for error messages

- Remove all the code you just added until it works again, and then add it in line by line

- Compare your code against the example Jupyter Notebook, all the technical section lectures have corresponding Jupyter Notebooks (notebooks with Python code and explanatory text) available for you to download and run. Make sure your code is exactly the like the Jupyter Notebooks!

2. Find Solutions Online

- Google the specific error message you got along with "Python"

- Search StackOverflow for your problem or error

- Google "How do I...." for what you are trying to do

3. If you do need to post to the discussion forum , ask good questions!

- Be Positive! Other students will be more likely to help out!

- Be specific, don't paste in a massive amount of code. Instead try posting a screenshot of the error message

- Try linking to the code hosted somewhere else, like a gist from GitHub
