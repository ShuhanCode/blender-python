    Problem - Find the Missing Element

    Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array. 

    Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

    Input:        
        finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])

    Output:
        5 is the missing number

    Solution

    Fill out your solution below:

    >>> finder ([5,5,7,7],[5,7,7])
    5 
    >>> finder ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6]) 
    5 
    >>> finder ([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1],[9,8,7,5,4,3,2,1])
    6 
    """
    pass
